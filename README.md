### About Me

I've *always* enjoyed working with technology. I enjoy solving problems, building solutions, and helping people succeed.

From the time I started learning how to type with [Mario Teaches Typing](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Mario_Teaches_Typing_1992), to building 
my first computer with a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5014046-build-your-own-pc) that my Aunt bought me, I knew I wanted to make a career of it.

Two decades have passed since I first started my journey. To this day, I still have a child-like curiousity and love for learning about and using new technologies.
